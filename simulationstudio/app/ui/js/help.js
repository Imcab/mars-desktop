     robot. It is a separate application from MARS Desktop on purpose: the simulation drags in
     the whole Gazebo environment, and that weight has no business travelling inside the
     dashboard your team runs at a competition.</p>
     <p>Two things live here:</p>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>Run</strong> — start, supervise and stop the three processes that make up a
       running simulation, and read their logs when one of them dies.</li>
       <li><strong>Author</strong> — create and edit the worlds the physics engine loads, import
       worlds and models from elsewhere, and inspect the robot maps that wire a robot's joints to
       its motor controllers.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>What it deliberately does <em>not</em> do is draw your robot. Gazebo's own window shows
     the physics, and MARS Desktop plots the telemetry — it receives poses over NT4 from the
