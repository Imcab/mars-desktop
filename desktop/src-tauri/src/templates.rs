//! The project and feature templates, carried inside the binary.
//!
//! Both used to be `git clone`d from GitHub every time the wizard ran, with the
//! `.git` deleted immediately afterwards -- so the clone was never about
//! history, only about getting the files. Paying for that with a network round
//! trip and a dependency on the `git` binary meant the most common first action
//! a new team takes ("create a project") failed on a bad connection, which at a
//! competition is most of them.
//!
//! It also meant the template could change under an app that was already
//! installed. That matters more than it sounds: `feature_gen` rewrites
//! `MarsFeature.json`, `build.gradle`, `settings.gradle` and the java package
//! tree by exact expectations about what the template contains. Renaming a
//! package in the template repository would have left every installed wizard
//! producing a project that does not compile, with nothing to warn anyone.
//! Embedded, the two versions cannot disagree.
//!
//! The tables come from `build.rs`; see it for what goes in.
