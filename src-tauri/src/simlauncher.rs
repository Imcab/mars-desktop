//! MARS Simulation Studio launcher.
//!
//! This is ALL mars-desktop knows about the simulation: where its executable is
//! and how to open it. Nothing about Gazebo lives here.
//!
//! The simulation is a separate application on purpose. It drags the whole
//! conda environment along --- Gazebo, its plugins, its dependencies --- and
//! that weight has no business inside the dashboard's bundle, which is what the
//! team uses at competition. It can also hang, update or be reinstalled without
//! touching the app that has to stay alive when it matters.
//!
//! The process is launched and let go: it is not supervised from here. The
//! Studio has its own window, its own life cycle and its own supervisor for the
//! simulation. Closing mars-desktop does not close the simulation, and that is
//! deliberate.
